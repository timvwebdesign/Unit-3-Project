 Project for unit 3

Added all files needed

<!-- Fixed Feedback -->

1.)
"Does not include all of the required form fields:"

First submission already included every form field.  This may have just been marked as wrong to be able to mark labels incorrect?



2.)
"Does not include labels for each form field."
"Labels are not properly associated with its form field."

Added labels to checkboxes and radio buttons 



3.)
"I also wanted to note that you are also forgetting this label on your <textarea> Get these sorted out and you'll be good to go"

Text area already contained the required label on first submission.
<label for="msg">Other topics you'd like to hear about</label>
<textarea id="msg" name="other-topics"></textarea>
is there something wrong with this code im missing?



4.)
"When checked with a validator the HTML and/or CSS code has errors which are not accepted exceptions."

Removed 'auto' from css line 58 referring to margin, causing this error.





All errors have been fixed.  It should properly exceed expectations now.
